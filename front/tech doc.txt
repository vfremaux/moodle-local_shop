### Shopping cart structure

Shopping cart is a SESSION variable that holds all session time data about
current purchase session.

$shoppingcart = $SESSION->shoppingcart;

Shopping cart holds and accumulate data and caches all along the purchase process,
forth and back between screens. Shopping cart is destroyed:

- When a purchase session concludes into a successful payment or placement order.
- When a shopping cart is reset by the user

Shopping cart should not be destroyed when a payment method fails, as the customer may
have other payment method or cards available to conclude positively the transaction.

Shopping cart vanishes out when the browser session is erased.

## Shopping cart data members

'order' : an array of "productcode" => quantity (integer) values

Order is result of product choice into the front office offer, or as result as a preloaded
order based on the input url decoding. Order is processed:

- by the shop.controller controller to calculate order taxes and global sums. (*)
- by the product customisation page if present (i.e. if at least one product calls for
customer custom data input)
- when "placing" order into the database (payment.controller)

(*) This means that the shoppingcart is recalculated each time the customer browses out
the product selection pages.
